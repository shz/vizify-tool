Debugging compile times

Full = 5.85s
Frameworks/glfw = 5.6s
Empty main.cpp = 2.4s
Only includes main.cpp = 5.6s
No include vizify, empty main.cpp = 0.6s
No include vizify, only includes main.cpp

GLFW include time: none
STDlib include time: 0.2s
vizify include time: 0.3s
gwv include time: 3s
$(SOURCES) compile time: 1.8s

So the meat of all the delay comes from gwv.  Explorations
in preventing includes (deltas):

director: 3s
drawers: 2s
renderers_graph: 2.3s
import_from_json: 0.9s
animutils: 0.8s
data_analyzer: 0.8s
